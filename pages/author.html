        <h2>About J.R.R. Tolkien</h2>
        <p>John Ronald Reuel Tolkien was born in 1892 in South Africa and later moved to England, where he became a prominent scholar of languages and literature. He is best known for his works *The Hobbit* and *The Lord of the Rings*, which have inspired generations of readers and writers. Tolkien's expertise in philology, his deep love of mythology, and his experiences in World War I deeply influenced his writing.</p>
        
        <p>Tolkien's work created the modern fantasy genre as we know it today, with its complex world-building, detailed histories, and fully realized characters. He drew upon Norse mythology, Anglo-Saxon literature, and his own creativity to craft the world of Middle-earth. *The Hobbit*, published in 1937, was his first major success, and it remains a beloved classic.</p>
