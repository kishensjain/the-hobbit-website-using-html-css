        <h2>Bilbo Baggins</h2>
        <p>Bilbo is the reluctant hero of the story. At the beginning, he is a quiet hobbit who prefers a simple life of comfort in the Shire. However, as the adventure progresses, Bilbo shows bravery, resourcefulness, and kindness. His transformation is central to the narrative, as he becomes a clever and courageous leader, especially when he faces Smaug and uses the ring to save his companions.</p>

        <h2>Gandalf</h2>
        <p>Gandalf is the wise and mysterious wizard who orchestrates the adventure. Though he disappears at critical moments, he always seems to reappear when most needed. His knowledge and power are crucial to the dwarves' journey, but his true role is to inspire Bilbo to grow and realize his potential.</p>

        <h2>Thorin Oakenshield</h2>
        <p>Thorin is the leader of the company of dwarves and heir to the throne of the Lonely Mountain. His quest to reclaim his homeland from Smaug is driven by both honor and pride. However, as they near the treasure, Thorin's obsession with gold begins to corrupt him, leading to tragic consequences. His relationship with Bilbo is complicated but ultimately respectful.</p>

        <h2>Smaug</h2>
        <p>Smaug is the fearsome dragon who hoards the treasure of the Lonely Mountain. His immense size and fiery breath make him a nearly invincible foe. Smaug's greed and arrogance are his defining traits, leading him to become a powerful yet isolated creature. The dragon's presence casts a long shadow over the quest of Bilbo and the dwarves, and his eventual defeat is a pivotal moment in the story.</p>

        <h2>Bard the Bowman</h2>
        <p>Bard is a brave and skilled archer from Lake-town (Esgaroth). He plays a crucial role in the story by ultimately slaying Smaug. Bard is depicted as a hero with a strong sense of justice and duty, driven by the desire to protect his people from the dragon’s wrath. His courageous act of using the black arrow to pierce Smaug’s heart marks the climax of the adventure and shifts the balance of power.</p>
