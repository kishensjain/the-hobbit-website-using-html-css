        <h2>Adventure and Growth</h2>
        <p>One of the central themes of *The Hobbit* is the idea of adventure as a transformative experience. Bilbo begins his journey as a cautious and reserved hobbit, but by embracing the adventure, he grows in confidence, strength, and wisdom. The journey itself is filled with challenges, dangers, and personal growth for all characters involved, particularly Bilbo.</p>

        <h2>Greed and its Consequences</h2>
        <p>The theme of greed is most prominently explored through the character of Thorin Oakenshield. As Thorin becomes more obsessed with the treasure of the Lonely Mountain, his judgment becomes clouded, leading to conflict with Bilbo and the other characters. Ultimately, the destructive nature of greed leads to the final battle and Thorin's downfall, serving as a cautionary tale.</p>

        <h2>Friendship and Loyalty</h2>
        <p>Despite the initial distrust between Bilbo and the dwarves, their relationship grows stronger as they journey together. Bilbo’s loyalty to the company, even when he faces danger or disagreements, exemplifies the power of friendship. Thorin’s eventual reconciliation with Bilbo highlights the theme of forgiveness and loyalty in the face of adversity.</p>

        <h2>The Power of Wisdom Over Strength</h2>
        <p>Throughout 'The Hobbit,' Bilbo proves that wisdom and quick thinking can often achieve more than brute strength. His encounters with Gollum and Smaug show that it’s not always physical prowess that wins the day but cleverness and intellect. Gandalf also embodies this theme as he provides guidance and insight rather than relying on sheer force to protect the group.</p>
