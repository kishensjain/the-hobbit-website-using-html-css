        <h2>Summary of The Hobbit</h2>
        <p>'The Hobbit' begins with the introduction of Bilbo Baggins, a simple hobbit who loves peace and quiet in his cozy home in the Shire. His peaceful existence is interrupted when Gandalf the wizard and thirteen dwarves arrive, seeking a burglar for their adventure. Their mission is to reclaim the Lonely Mountain and the treasure guarded by the fearsome dragon Smaug. Initially hesitant, Bilbo is swept into the journey, facing trolls, goblins, and even Gollum, from whom he acquires a mysterious ring.</p>
        
        <p>As the story progresses, Bilbo transforms from a reluctant participant into a brave and resourceful hero. He plays a pivotal role in guiding the group through danger, outwitting giant spiders, escaping from wood elves, and ultimately confronting Smaug. The adventure culminates in the Battle of the Five Armies, where alliances are tested and Bilbo's courage shines. In the end, Bilbo returns home, forever changed by the adventure, yet happy to be back in his quiet life.</p>
